                    <p class="client-info">The Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD) is an organization that provides a wide
                            variety of health services to over 400 000 residents along the South coast of NSW, ranging north to
                            Helensburgh all the way down south towards Ulladulla. It was formed in 1st January 2011 after the
                            dissolution of South Eastern Sydney Illawarra Area Health Service. It is the region largest employers
                            with 7300 employees that runs 8 hospitals such as Bulli, Wollongong, Port Kembla and Shellharbour
                            hospital and services like aged care, cancer, drugs and alcohol addiction etc.<br><br>
                            ISLHD aims to serve the community in terms of healthcare and wellbeing that includes both physical
                            and mental health, as they aim “To provide best practice health care and programs that promote the
                            health and wellbeing of people in the Illawarra Shoalhaven”(Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health
                            District About us,). Part of that includes providing the necessarily programs and services to deal
                            with mental health in the Illawarra. Mental health has become a controversial topic and has become
                            a topic of crucial research. Though its widespread, there are not many services out there to support
                            people with mental illness or monitor it in the Illawarra. Because of this, ISLHD has required Codify
                            Solutions to make a program that will provide assistance to school teachers by providing them
                            interventions in dealing with mental illnesses. This is vital as research shows that 1 in 7 children
                            suffer from mental health problems. This is unnerving as children are still in their development
                            leaning phase and should have good mental health. The Software would list all the mental health
                            problems along with information like behaviour, analysis and interventions. This software would be
                            useful in supporting mental health in the region along as a start off base for more projects in the
                            future to improve mental health locally.</p>
